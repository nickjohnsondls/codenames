# codenames
Codenames project repository (Michigan Data Science Team)

In this repository you will find two data files (the file with the codenames word data and the english dictionary data with words and their definitions). You will also find a file that allows you to load the dictionary data and create a simple Word2Vec model with it. This Word2Vec model will be the foundation to our project.
